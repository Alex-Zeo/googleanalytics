This Python script is designed to automate the retrieval of Google Analytics 4 (GA4) data for the Atlanta Convention & Visitors Bureauâ€™s Marketing Dashboard. By leveraging the Google Analytics Data API, the script extracts key metrics and dimensions for the previous month, including sessions, active users, and event counts. The retrieved data is systematically organized and saved as Excel files in a designated OneDrive directory, ensuring that marketing teams have timely access to essential performance metrics for informed decision-making.

To set up and use the script, ensure that all required Python libraries are installed, including pandas, configparser, and the Google Analytics API client libraries. The script relies on a configuration file (ga4config.ini) that contains necessary credentials and property IDs. It is crucial to securely manage this configuration file, as it includes sensitive service account information required for authentication with the Google Analytics API. Once the configuration is properly set, the script can be executed to automatically create necessary directories, log its operations, and handle data pagination to ensure comprehensive data retrieval.

Upon execution, the script performs several key functions: it verifies the existence of the target directory and creates it if necessary, logs each step of the data retrieval process for transparency and debugging, and processes the fetched data into a structured pandas DataFrame. Finally, the DataFrame is exported to an Excel file, making it easily accessible for further analysis and reporting. This automation not only streamlines the data collection process but also enhances the reliability and consistency of marketing metrics, empowering the team to focus on strategic initiatives rather than manual data handling.
